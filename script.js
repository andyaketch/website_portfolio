It combines RSEI (Remote Sensing Ecological Index) and LULC (Land Use/Land Cover) classification with SHAP analysis to interpret which factors are driving the changes detected in satellite imagery. The findings were written up as a Medium blog series, translating the technical analysis into a narrative on how the county's land and environment are shifting over time.",
